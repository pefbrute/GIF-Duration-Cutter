# GIF-Duration-Cutter
Crop GIFs easily with my new project! If you've seen my past work, you know I love using GIFs. Tired of slow or weird online tools? My project simplifies it all. Forget typing commands or frame numbers every timeâ€”this tool does it for you, showing total frames and letting you pick start and end frames for a perfect GIF!
